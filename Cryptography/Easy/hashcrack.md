Welcome!! Looking For the Secret?

We have identified a hash: 482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38
Enter the password for identified hash:
```

**Here they give us a hash, and we have to enter the password for this hash (the password before being hashed).**

**We have to find the hash type first with a `hash analyzer` then crack it using some tools like `hashcat` using a word list.**

**But we can easily use `web sites` that use a big databases and tables to crack hashes fast. in my case i'm using `https://crackstation.net/`.**

Correct! You've cracked the SHA-256 hash with a secret found. 
The flag is: picoCTF{UseStr0nG_h@shEs_&PaSswDs!_4c95d69f}
